# Project 03: Company Fleet Selection Using Weighted Scoring
> This project explores an analysis using the weighted scoring method on selecting one of the four vehicles as part of the company fleet: 2019 Ford Escape, 2019 Honda CR-V, 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe, and 2019 Toyota RAV4. The requirements for the vehicles are based on safety features, maintenance cost, price point, insurance, fuel economy, and resale value. In order to present this analysis to management on car selection, a data visualization tool, Tableau, is used to present my decision.

The project is part of a graduate course (_Advance Data Visualization_) at Western Governor's University. The data will not be provided, but rather an explanation of insights. 

Summary
---
A web scraper is created by using Python and scraped 227 links from the [Population and Housing Unit Estimates web page](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html). In order to get only unique links, a for loop is created which resulted in 119 unique links.

The ratings are collected from [JD Power](https://www.jdpower.com/) and the weight is based on the company's requirements and I. The company's criteria are safety features, maintenance cost, and price point while my criteria are insurance, fuel economy, and resale value. In the above table above, it is a weighted scoring table with the combined six criterias. The weighted value is Rating x Weighting. The Weighted Rating is the sum of the weighted value over sum of weight per vehicle.

For the companyâ€™s criteria which are safety features, maintenance cost, and price point, one can notice that maintenance cost and price point for the 2019 Honda CR-V in Figure 6 are higher than at least 2 other vehicles. While the price point is ranked second compared to the 2019 Ford Escape, we can dig deeper into pricing and will notice that we can get a better deal at our local dealership.
